## Deployment Steps

These are notes for deploying to NPM. I used `npmrc` to manage my NPM identities
(`npm i npmrc -g` to install ). Then I created a new profile called `public` with
(`npmrc -c public`) and then switch to it with `npmrc public`.

* create a pull request from `dev` to `main`
* check out `main`
* `npm version patch -m "message here" or minor`
* `npm publish --access public`
* Then switch to `dev` branch
* And then merge `main` into `dev` and push `dev` to origin
